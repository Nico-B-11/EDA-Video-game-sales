### EDA-Video-game-sales

Hi,

this is my first data analysis project. The dataset is from Kaggle: [Video game sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales)

I tried to answer the following questions:

1.Which game had the most sales in Japan?    
2.Which Pokemon game was the most successful in terms of worldwide sales?    
3.Create 4 side by side graphs showing sales per genre and market (each market a separate graph)    
4.Which game had the highest share of worldwide sales in which market? For all markers, the game should have been sold at least once.    
5.Create a line chart of Nintendo's cumulated numbers over the years.    
6.Compare the percentage increase from year to year of the genres Action, Sports & Shooter? Which has the most growth in % from 2013 - 2015 years?    
7.Create a stacked bar chart for Nintendo, Electronic Arts & Activision for the sales 2000 - 2006 for the market Europe.    
8.Create a line chart of the cumulated numbers of all market sales over the years.    


Goal was to have each result in a table and as a visualization if possible to get more familiar with Python.
